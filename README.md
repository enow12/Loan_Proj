The goal of this project is to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer details provided when filling out an online application form. The details are Credit history, Applicant income, Loan amount, Co-applicant income and others. The motivation is that based on values entered in the form, the applicant will be able to have a feeling ahead of time whether there is a good chance of having a loan approved or denied.
Generally, loan approval involves the lender looking at various background information about the applicant and deciding whether they should grant the loan. Parameters like credit score, loan amount, lifestyle, career, and assets are the deciding factors in getting the loan approved. This project seeks to serve as an initial screening point for loan applicants and to help the lender to save valuable time and other resources of going through the initial screening exercise for loan applicants. 
The dataset was taken from UCI Credit Risk Dataset for Loan Prediction.
